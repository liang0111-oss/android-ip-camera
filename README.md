## Features

* 🌎 Built in server, just open the video stream in a web browser, video app or even set it as a Home Assistant MJPEG IP Camera (using `https://<ip_address>:4444/stream`)
* 📴 Option to turn the display off while streaming
* 🤳 Switch between the main or selfie camera
* 🎛️ Remote web interface with controls for camera section, image rotation, audio/video sync, flash light toggle, resolution, zoom, exposure and contrast
* 🖼️ Choose between different image quality settings and frame rates (to help reduce phone over heating)
* 🛂 Username and password protection
* 🔐 Automatic TLS certificate support to protect stream and login details via HTTPS

## ⚠️ Warning

If you are planning to run this 24/7, please make sure that your phone does not stay at 100% charge. Doing so may damage the battery and cause it to swell up, which could cause it to explode.

Some models include an option to only charge to 80%, make sure this is enabled where possible.

Note: running at a higher image quality may cause some phones to over heat, which can also damage the battery.

## HTTPS/TLS certificates

To protect the stream and the password from being sent in plain-text over HTTP, a certificate can be used to start the stream over HTTPS.

The app will automatically generate a self-signed certificate on first launch, but if you have your own domain you can use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) to generate a trusted certificate and skip the self-signed security warning message, by changing the TLS certificate in the settings.

To generate a new self-signed certificate, clear the app settings and restart or clone this repo and run `./scripts/generate-certificate.sh` then use the certificate `personal_certificate.p12` file it generates.

<summary>Reproducible builds</summary>

This project uses [reproducible builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds/). Release APKs should be built from a clean tree at the tagged commit using Gradle directly:

```bash
./gradlew clean assembleRelease
```

The release variant will automatically sign the APK build. Build-tools 35+ is known to produce signatures that fail reproducibility verification.

### Build Variants

By default, release builds generate architecture-specific APK splits (armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a) in addition to a universal APK. For F-Droid and other scenarios where a single universal APK is preferred, you can disable ABI splits:

**F-Droid builds (single universal APK):**
```bash
./gradlew clean assembleRelease -PenableAbiSplits=false
```

**Release builds with architecture-specific APKs (default):**
```bash
./gradlew clean assembleRelease
```

The `enableAbiSplits` property defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` to generate only the universal APK, which is the recommended approach for F-Droid to avoid unnecessary complexity in the build pipeline.

To verify that two unsigned builds from the same source are identical:

```bash
mkdir -p build/unsigned
./gradlew clean assembleRelease -PskipSigning --no-daemon --max-workers=1 -Dorg.gradle.parallel=false
cp app/build/outputs/apk/release/*universal-release.apk build/unsigned/build1.apk
./gradlew clean assembleRelease -PskipSigning --no-daemon --max-workers=1 -Dorg.gradle.parallel=false
cp app/build/outputs/apk/release/*universal-release.apk build/unsigned/build2.apk
cmp -s build/unsigned/build1.apk build/unsigned/build2.apk && echo OK
# or: shasum -a 256 build/unsigned/build1.apk build/unsigned/build2.apk
```

If they differ, inspect with `diffoscope build/unsigned/build1.apk build/unsigned/build2.apk`.

To verify your **signed** release APK matches an unsigned rebuild use `apksigcopier` - the first APK must be signed:

```bash
./gradlew clean assembleRelease
apksigcopier compare app/build/outputs/apk/release/*universal-release.apk --unsigned build/unsigned/build1.apk && echo OK
```

CI runs this check automatically via the [Reproducible Build workflow](.github/workflows/reproducible-build.yml).

Builds downloaded from the [official repository](https://github.com/DigitallyRefined/android-ip-camera/releases) should match the following signing certificate:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs app/build/outputs/apk/release/*universal-release.apk
Signer #1 certificate DN: CN=DigitallyRefined
Signer #1 certificate SHA-256 digest: 1111be81c861e199c6485d367c37680c4b778fba301980d2f0f9a2800f77f70a
Signer #1 certificate SHA-1 digest: 1560ceccdd719b2b97d431ad9a4c877abf5c2f32
Signer #1 certificate MD5 digest: 5fdf04f5b6bab9fdacbe28aa6dc85abb
```
